        <h2>Hey everyone,</h2>
            <p class="introP">We hope you all have had a great holiday season and that your 2019 started off well. With February approaching we've decided to make a changelist with changes during January. As features are added when they are readily available for testing it can be difficult to keep track on what’s been added, removed or modified. Some changes are part due to community feedback - so thank you to anyone who has left valuable feedback that continues to grow the server.<br><br>
            We're planning on adding The Hall of Fame, too. Your 300 score will not be forgotten -- and your face (well, your profile picture) will be forever plastered somewhere on the map sometime soon... we promise.</p>

        <h3>Condos & Renting</h3>
        <div id="changes">
        <h4>Condos</h4>
        <p class="listP">Added the Luxury Condo</p>
        <p class="listP">Added the Furniture Store</p>
        <p class="listP">Added the ability to rent condos and customise furniture (beta phase)</p>
        <p class="descP">We have added the Luxury Condo as part of an expansion to add player customisable condos and rooms to the server. This will be a testing environment for future condo and renting projects.</p>
        <p class="subP">You can purchase furniture/equipment, rent out a condo and customise it to your wants and desires -- invite your friends (or strangers) and chill in your space with your rules. Please bear in mind that changes are likely to happen during this testing phase - many things (such as prices and customisation) <i>will</i> be changed.</p>

        <h4>Go-Karting</h4>
        <p class="listP">Added Go-Karts</p>
        <p class="listP">Added the Go-Kart Deathmatch gamemode</p>
        <p class="descP">Go Kart vehicles have been added to the server and are being worked into a Deathmatch mode and will be available very soon. Some of you have already tested out the new Karts already and they will be worked on for February.</p>
        <p class="subP">Go Kart Deathmatch will be available in the Game Room. Players will ride their Karts in an open arena (work in progress) and can use Mouse 1 to fire bombs (which use bowling ball trails) to take out enemies. The game's rules will be changed constantly until they feel right - be sure to suggest any rule/gamemode changes through the feedback machines.</p>
        <p class="descP">Whilst Go-Kart DM is available -- a proper Racing course will be a project for the developers. It's far on the horizon, but is a goal for Karting.</p>
